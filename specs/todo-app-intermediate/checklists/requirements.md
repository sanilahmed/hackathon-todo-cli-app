# Requirements Validation Checklist: The Evolution of Todo – Phase II (Intermediate Level)

**Purpose**: Validation checklist for Phase II requirements including priorities, tags, search, filter, and sort functionality
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: /specs/todo-app-intermediate/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/sp.checklist` command based on feature requirements and specifications.

## Priorities & Tags Requirements

- [ ] CHK001 Task supports priority attribute (high/medium/low values)
- [ ] CHK002 Default priority is medium when not specified
- [ ] CHK003 Task supports multiple tags (comma-separated list)
- [ ] CHK004 Tags can be assigned during task creation
- [ ] CHK005 Priority and tags are displayed when viewing tasks
- [ ] CHK006 Existing tasks without priority default to medium priority in display

## Search Requirements

- [ ] CHK007 Search functionality available via CLI command
- [ ] CHK008 Search works by keyword in task description
- [ ] CHK009 Search is case-insensitive
- [ ] CHK010 Search returns all matching tasks
- [ ] CHK011 Search handles no matches with appropriate message
- [ ] CHK012 Search works with partial matches

## Filter Requirements

- [ ] CHK013 Filter by completion status (complete/incomplete)
- [ ] CHK014 Filter by priority level (high/medium/low)
- [ ] CHK015 Filter by date (when present)
- [ ] CHK016 Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [ ] CHK017 Filter handles no matches with appropriate message
- [ ] CHK018 Filter results can be combined with other operations

## Sort Requirements

- [ ] CHK019 Sort by due date (chronological order)
- [ ] CHK020 Sort by priority (high to low)
- [ ] CHK021 Sort alphabetically by task title
- [ ] CHK022 Sort does not mutate stored data
- [ ] CHK023 Sort results are temporary display only
- [ ] CHK024 Sort can be combined with filter operations

## CLI Behavior Requirements

- [ ] CHK025 All new features accessible via interactive CLI
- [ ] CHK026 New commands discoverable via `help` command
- [ ] CHK027 Input guidance provided for new commands
- [ ] CHK028 Default values used where appropriate
- [ ] CHK029 Validation prevents invalid inputs
- [ ] CHK030 Error messages are human-readable without stack traces

## Architecture Constraints

- [ ] CHK031 Existing task model extended without rewrite
- [ ] CHK032 Business logic remains separate from CLI parsing
- [ ] CHK033 Code remains modular and extensible
- [ ] CHK034 No external dependencies added beyond Python standard library
- [ ] CHK035 Python 3.13+ compatibility maintained
- [ ] CHK036 Clear separation between core logic and CLI interface

## Data Handling Requirements

- [ ] CHK037 Task data structure supports priority, tags, and future fields
- [ ] CHK038 Backward compatibility maintained with existing tasks
- [ ] CHK039 Existing CLI commands continue to work without changes
- [ ] CHK040 Task IDs remain consistent across operations
- [ ] CHK041 Data integrity preserved during all operations
- [ ] CHK042 Task metadata properly stored and retrieved

## Success Criteria Validation

- [ ] CHK043 User can assign and view priorities via CLI
- [ ] CHK044 User can assign and view tags via CLI
- [ ] CHK045 User can search tasks by keyword intuitively
- [ ] CHK046 User can filter tasks by various criteria intuitively
- [ ] CHK047 User can sort tasks by various criteria intuitively
- [ ] CHK048 All existing commands continue to work without changes
- [ ] CHK049 Codebase remains clean, readable, and extensible
- [ ] CHK050 Performance remains acceptable with new features
